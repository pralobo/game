(1) Draw the checkerboard in Manager:
    -- get the right image into a surface
    -- put the surface into a frame
    -- draw the frame in manager.cpp

(2) Add the World and Viewport to Manager:
    -- put world.h and viewport.h into manager.h
    -- initialize them in manager.cpp
    -- set the objectToTrack in the constructor for Manager
    -- draw the world
    -- update the viewport
    -- update the world

(3) Modify frame.cpp so that it draws the object in viewport
    coordinates rather than world coordinates:
  x -= Viewport::getInstance().X();
  y -= Viewport::getInstance().Y();
  include viewport.h in frame.cpp

(4) Change the game.xml file so that the viewport is, say, 640x480
    and the world is 1280x960

(5) add world and viewport to the Makefile

(6) compile and watch!
